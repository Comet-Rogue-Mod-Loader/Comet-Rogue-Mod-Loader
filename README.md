# Install
Extract the downloaded .zip archive in your Comet Rogue folder, which is located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Comet Rogue\" by default.
I would recommend making a new folder and copying all of the files there so you have one modded and one vanilla instance

# Adding mods
Add .pck mods to "Mods" folder
